# Azure InsightScape (Monitor and back up Azure resources)

Design a comprehensive monitoring dashboard to gain insights, troubleshoot, and ensure smooth operations for all your previous projects. With this centralized monitoring solution, track the health, performance, and security of all integrated services.

- **Programming required?**: ‚ùå (This project relies mostly on configuration and integration, though understanding of Kusto Query Language (KQL) will be essential for custom monitoring queries.)
- **Azure Services Used:**
  - Azure Monitor
  - Azure Log Analytics
  - Azure Security Center
  - Azure Alerts
  - Azure Application Insights (for the web applications)
  - Azure Network Watcher (for networking projects)
  
- **Steps**:
   1. **Azure Monitor Integration**:
        - Set up Azure Monitor to collect telemetry data from all your Azure resources involved in the previous projects.
        - Enable multi-resource monitoring to see health and metrics across projects and services.

   2. **Log Analytics Workspace**:
        - Provision a Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor.
        - Integrate your services (like VMs, Web Apps, Logic Apps, Blob Storage) from previous projects into this workspace.
        - Write KQL queries to fetch specific log data, e.g., failed login attempts, high resource utilization, or abnormal network traffic patterns.

   3. **Application Insights**:
        - For the "ShareSafely - File Share Web App" project, integrate Azure Application Insights to capture telemetry data like user sessions, page views, and exceptions.
        - Visualize the performance of your web application and identify any bottlenecks or issues.

   4. **Network Monitoring**:
        - Use Azure Network Watcher to monitor the networking aspects from the "NetMaze Explorer" project.
        - Capture network packet data, check for any security threats, and analyze network topology.

   5. **Security & Compliance**:
        - Integrate Azure Security Center to get a unified view of the security posture across all projects.
        - Ensure compliance standards are met and get recommendations to improve the security of your resources.

   6. **Alerts Configuration**:
        - Based on the data from Log Analytics and Application Insights, set up Azure Alerts.
        - Configure notifications for unusual activities, like resource downtimes, security breaches, or performance degradation.

   7. **Dashboard Creation**:
        - Customize the Azure Monitor dashboard to display critical metrics, logs, and alerts for all projects in one place.
        - Share the dashboard with your team to ensure everyone has visibility into the system's health.

   8. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**:
        - Set up periodic backups for critical data across your projects.
        - Design a disaster recovery plan, and periodically test the recovery of services to ensure data integrity and availability in case of any failures.

   9. **Documentation & Best Practices**:
        - Document your monitoring strategies, KQL queries, and setup configurations.
        - Ensure you follow Azure's best practices for monitoring and alerting, optimizing costs, and resource usage.
