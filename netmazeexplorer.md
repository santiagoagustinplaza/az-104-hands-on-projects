# NetMaze Explorer (Implement and manage virtual networking)

Design a hybrid networking environment where on-premises networks connect securely to Azure resources using Azure's networking capabilities, ensuring secure data transition and effective resource access controls.
- **Programming required?**: ‚ùå Minimal to none. This project is largely focused on networking configurations, but understanding scripting for automating certain tasks or deploying resources could be beneficial.
- **Azure Services Used:**
    - Azure Virtual Networks
    - Azure VPN Gateway
    - Network Security Groups (NSGs)
    - Azure Bastion
    - Azure Private Link
    - Azure DNS
    - Azure Load Balancer
- **Steps:**

   1. Azure Virtual Network Setup:

        Provision an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) in your chosen region.
    Create multiple subnets within this VNet to segregate resources effectively (e.g., WebApp Subnet, Database Subnet, Admin Subnet).

    2. On-Premises Network Simulation:

        For the sake of this project, use another VNet to simulate your on-premises environment. This can be in another Azure region or the same region based on preference.

    3. Secure Connectivity:

        Implement Azure VPN Gateway to create a site-to-site VPN connection between your simulated on-premises environment (VNet) and your main Azure VNet.
    Verify the connection and ensure resources from one VNet can communicate with another, effectively simulating a hybrid environment.

    4. Resource Deployment

        Deploy test resources (like VMs) in each subnet of your main Azure VNet. For instance, deploy a web server VM in the WebApp Subnet, a database in the Database Subnet, etc.

    5. Network Access Control:

        Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) to define inbound and outbound access rules for each subnet, ensuring that only valid traffic is allowed. For instance, only allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the WebApp Subnet.

    6. Secure Administrative Access:

        Implement Azure Bastion for secure and seamless RDP and SSH access to your virtual machines, ensuring you don't expose your VMs to the public internet.

    7. Private Access to Azure PaaS Services:

        Use Azure Private Link to access Azure PaaS services (like Azure SQL Database) over a private endpoint within your VNet, ensuring data doesn't traverse over the public internet.

    8. DNS and Load Balancing:

        Configure Azure DNS to have custom domain names for your resources.
    Implement Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic across your VMs in the WebApp Subnet.

    9. Performance and Security Testing:

        Simulate various network scenarios to test performance, such as data transition between on-premises and Azure.
    Attempt to access resources from outside the permitted paths to validate the security configurations in place.

    10. Monitoring and Auditing:

        Enable monitoring and diagnostics on your VPN Gateway, NSGs, and other network resources to gain insights into network operations.
    Review logs and set up alerts for any suspicious activities.
