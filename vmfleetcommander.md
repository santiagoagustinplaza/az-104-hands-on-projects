# VM Fleet Commander (Deploy and manage Azure compute resources)
Implement an infrastructure-as-code approach to provision and manage virtual machines in Azure, using ARM templates and Bicep. The aim is to gain hands-on experience in automating the deployment of Azure resources and organizing them efficiently.

- **Programming required?**: âœ… (Knowledge of JSON for ARM templates and Bicep language syntax is essential.)
- **Azure Services Used:**
  - Azure Virtual Machines
  - Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
  - Bicep
  
- **Steps**:

   1. **Initial Setup**:
      - Ensure you have Azure CLI installed with Bicep support.
      - Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes in your Bicep and ARM templates.

   2. **Bicep Basics**:
      - Start with learning the basics of Bicep syntax and structure.
      - Convert a basic ARM template (like one that deploys a single VM) to Bicep to understand the differences.

   3. **Resource Group and Naming Conventions**:
      - Define a Bicep file to create an Azure Resource Group for your VMs.
      - Implement naming conventions for your resources using Bicep's string functions.

   4. **Virtual Machine Provisioning**:
      - Create a Bicep module for deploying Azure VMs, allowing for parameterized input like VM size, name, and region.
      - Use loops in Bicep to deploy multiple VM instances based on a specified count.

   5. **Network Resources**:
      - Design Bicep modules for associated networking resources like Virtual Network, Subnet, and Network Security Groups.
      - Ensure your VMs are provisioned within the designated VNet and have the necessary security rules applied.

   6. **Parameter Files and Validation**:
      - Create separate parameter files for your Bicep templates, allowing for different environment deployments (e.g., dev, test, prod).
      - Use the Azure CLI to validate your Bicep files before deploying, catching any structural errors.

   7. **Deployment**:
      - Use the Azure CLI to deploy your Bicep templates, creating all designated resources.
      - Test the reproducibility by deploying the same infrastructure to a different region or resource group.

   8. **Maintenance & Updates**:
      - Make changes to your Bicep files (e.g., VM size or count) and redeploy. Observe how Azure handles updates and maintains state.
      - Regularly pull updates to the Bicep language and Azure CLI to stay updated with new features and improvements.

   9. **Documentation & Cleanup**:
      - Document your Bicep modules, their purpose, and any parameters required.
      - After testing, ensure to delete resources or resource groups to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.
